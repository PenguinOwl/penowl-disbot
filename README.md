# General Help for Taxbot
Commands
--------
=help
--------
Not hard to guess what this does.

=taxes [users]
--------
Displays tax information. Whenever you send a message you get taxed. (taxes are just for fun, and all they do is hinder you from prestiging, so donâ€™t worry about racking them up.)

=balance [users]
--------
Displays balance. 
Aliases: bal, money

=info [user]
--------
Displays everything you need to know. 

=stats [user]
--------
Displays everything you need to know without borders.

=pay (user) (amount) 
--------
Give someone some of your money.
(note that you cannot pay people relatively large amounts of money)

=collect
--------
Collect your hourly wages.
Gain an extra +10% for each prestige level.

=invest
--------
invest money (shown in =info) to increase your hourly payment. (1/3 to fail and lose hourly wages)

=lobby (investments|taxes|rates)
--------
lobby the government to decrease one of your debts. Getting sued boosts your taxes.   (1/25 to fail on weekends and 1/5 to fail on weekdays)

=top [bal|invest|lbcount|pres]
--------
See the leaderboards.

=freeze
--------
Opt out of tax bot so you can message without getting taxed. (resets balance, but you can opt back in at anytime)

=paytaxes 
--------
Pay your taxes.
(On last five days of the month. You will not accumulate any taxes until the next month..)

=prestige
--------
CARRIES ACROSS ALL SERVERS

Reset for cool perks. Gives one upgrade level and point for each order of magnitude over 1M in your balance.

1M = 1 prestige level & point 
10M = 2 prestige levels & points 
100M = 3 prestige levels & points
1B = 4 prestige levels & points
10B = 5 prestige levels & points
... 

=upgrade (bonus|steal|auto)
--------
Upgrade a perk: bonus, steal, or auto. (Bonus gives a bonus for investing, steal lets you steal some from people, and auto gives you a free hourly reward once per day per level.) 

It takes one extra point for each upgrade, e.g.
Bonus lvl 1 = 1 point
Bonus lvl 2 = 2 points (3 in total)
Bonus lvl 3 = 3 points (6 in total)
Bonus lvl 4 = 4 points (10 in total)
Bonus lvl 5 = 5 points (15 in total)
